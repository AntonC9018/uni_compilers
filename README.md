# Compiler Theory

This repository contains assignments, implemented as part of the course *Compiler Theory*.

See explanatory markdown documents for each of the assignments in the doc folder. Assignments are all in *Romanian*.

The markdown files use [tex math formulas, which won't show on github](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11256433/how-to-show-math-equations-in-general-githubs-markdownnot-githubs-blog). To see formulas, you will either have to convert markdown to html or pdf, with [`MathJax`](https://www.mathjax.org/) enabled, or find the compiled pdf's [on my google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Rs0-qy6ivSDuHh5JadrP4Ta4YDhuVRiC).

I've been using [this plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzane.markdown-pdf) for vscode to convert the markdown into pdf. To apply the template with latex support that I use, replace the file `%USER%/.vscode/extensions/yzane.markdown-pdf-1.4.4/template/template.html` with the template.html from the root of the project.

PR's with grammar corrections, bug fixes, improvement suggestions or translations are very welcome.

Leave a star as a way to say "Thank you". Enjoy!
